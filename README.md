# Zebrafish Bipolar Cells
This repository contains code written to analyze single cell RNA sequencing data for zebrafish bipolar cells (BCs) associated with the paper "Ancient origin of the vertebrate rod bipolar cell pathway: a conserved and a novel rod bipolar cell pathways in zebrafish". The analysis heavily relies on the R package Seurat and may be useful to users who wish to reproduce the results of the paper or try alternative analysis strategies. The raw sequence data associated with the publication is publicly available through the Gene Expression Omnibus (accession number GSE237214), while the Seurat objects are available through Google Drive here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lznbUYk76sD_3n5T_tIpwiZ9D_ZHoq8d?usp=sharing.

Please direct any questions associated with this repository to Joshua Hahn (joshhahn@berkeley.edu) or Karthik Shekhar (kshekhar@berkeley.edu).

This repository contains one R notebook, which details how the final zebrafish type object was generated, as well as how figures were generated for the publication. In addition to these notebooks, a variety of custom scripts are available in the utils folder to simplify the analysis.
